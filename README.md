# Disclaimer
As of 26/07/2022 VRChat released an update which includes a kernel anti-cheat known as [**Easy Anti-Cheat**](https://easy.ac).
This is a horrible change and will harm VRChat more than it will help it. VRChat has always had a honestly terrible stance on (even wholesome) modding, but we co-existed without any big problems.

Now they want to block all Quality of Life mods, all protection mods like [AdvancedSafety](https://github.com/knah/VRCMods#advancedsafety) and [NetworkSanity](https://github.com/RequiDev/NetworkSanity) that prevented you from crashing from common crashing methods.
All of that, only to prevent a minority of malicious and toxic people in the game that also happen to use mods to be a nuisance around other people.

With this change people using crashers will be more powerful than before. People using (Photon-)Bots will be more powerful than before. Because **YOU** won't have any protection due to Easy Anti-Cheat.

This free service to search for avatars won't be available for the time being. If VRChat decides to stick with EAC I will be shutting it down entirely and maybe release the database to the public.

If you are subscribed to VRC+ and think this change shouldn't happen, cancel your subscription. That's probably the only way they will listen.

In the meantime, feel free to check out the private server project which aims at hosting your own VRChat by emulating its services:

To VRChat:  
Come on. You can do better.

# NetworkSanity
A MelonLoader mod for the game VRChat to prevent certain photon "exploits" from affecting you.

# Description
This mod is supposed to check whether an RPC is valid or not to prevent crashes/freezes and also ratelimits people spamming a lot of them at once.
Apart from that there are patches that will catch other exploits and block events from people spamming invalid events.
